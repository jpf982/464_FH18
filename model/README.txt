       THIN FILM TRANSMISSION MODELLING SOFTWARE
========================================================

First, I have set this up to run in Linux 
	-- unsure how to run this in windows, sorry
To install many of the necessary packages, I have included the "init.sh"
that you may run. Naturally, environment variables, etc, may need exporting. 

To run the code, you may look at the code that is initalized in the 
"thinfilm.jl" file, and modify it as you please. For my environment,
I am using Windows Subsystem for Linux with an XServer client. 

I can run the software using "julia -i thinfilm.jl" to get
interactive plots, though "julia thinfilm.jl" should just be necessary
once I have it set up to print and record the spectra, etc. 


Can be contacted at Vivian.rogers@utexas.edu or on slack if need be


Cheers
